BACKLOG-ISH

Create new clean pyod based code for anomaly detection using pyod based on pre-processed and feature engineered input
Add k-step depth to k-core/egonetwork. Will require broader filetering. Filtering on specific account cant be done during load.  
Add preview networkx based visualisation in coded creating egonet file. 

DONE!

✅ Add pre-moddeling block to handle NaN:s for example 
✅ Clean upp "old" transaction-level entropy code
✅ Fix feature creation recommendation based on recommendations (see https://chatgpt.com/c/692a0373-9324-8332-87a5-980adba54cfc)
✅ Change entropy to account level (first )
✅ Add weekday as feature on transaction level
✅ Add entropy as features on transaction level for "Ammount Paid" -> Trackning of entropy over time over rolling window
✅ Add sampling capability before adding features
✅ Add timer for performance tracking in main 
✅ Include is laundering flag i data before adde to model 
✅ Make feature engineered file available for use with DBSCAN code. 
✅ Tidy up DBSCAN code to be more self contained (remove unecessary dependencies)
✅ Add payment format/currency graphs to existing display (now they are separate output windows.)
✅ Add aggregation of currency and format used for deep analysis of suspicious account
✅ OAdd more eye-friendly output to univariat EDA.File and visual table maybe. 
✅ One-hot ecdoding for payment currency  -> Add to feature creation code 
✅ Add out-/inbound counterpart split to output (visual and excel) for suspicious account deep dive. 
✅ One-hot encoding of Payment format to feature generating code
✅ Add out-/inbound counterpart split to output (visual and excel) for suspicious account deep dive. 
✅ Add excel or csv output to code for checking specific account
✅ In check flagged account -> visualize inbound transactions as well (add serie to existing graph)
✅ Add new py file for buiding egonewtork files for suspicious account (see gpt conversation).
✅ Add summary to code for check flagged account. Number of in-/outbound tx during the period.mean, median mode etc.
